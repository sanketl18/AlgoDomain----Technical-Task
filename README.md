E-Commerce web application created using spring boot (backend) and react (frontend).
This Web application is based on microservice architecture, Eureka server is used for registering microservice and for load balancing.
Rest template is used to consume json data from other microservices. exchange of json data is done by using rest template.
All the microservice are called using spring cloud Api gateway on a single port(9090).
This web application follows polygate architecture for databases. I use both SQL and NoSQL type of datbases, which are MySQL and MongoDB.
Appliction is protected with spring security and authentication is done using JWT (Java Web Token).
Paytm is as a Payment Gateway in this application.
Spring Boot (Backend) is integrated with React (Frontend) using Axios library .
